# Angular4-Markdown Editor

This is a minimal markdown editor developed using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) framework, and the project scaffold is generated using the awesome [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). This project is inspired by [Live Markdown Editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor)



## Dependencies

* CodeMirror: 'a versatile text editor'
* Markdown-it: generates HTML from markdown code. 
* Highlight.js: complements the Markdown-it to have syntax highlighting for code blocks.
* ng2-bootstrap: provides Bootstrap components for Angular2 web app. For the time being I just use to make tooltips and modals. 
* RxJs5: an amazing library for managing events and states!  It's also possible to greatly improve Angular change detection performance with the help of Observables 
* FuzzySearch: a lightweight fuzzy search library with zero dependency.
